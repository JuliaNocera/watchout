#watchout
Using D3, we implemented a game. You have to avoid the enemy zombies and survive as long as possible without being hit. You will find a high score and current score to keep track of your progress. 

This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta). This project was worked on with a pair.
